Calculator Challenge

My project is a mini-game which I based off of a mobile game called The Calculator Game.
The original game is made from Simple Machine.
The idea of my version is to shrink the game into a smaller chunk.

The goal is the same of aiming to hit a number given a starting point, but my version differs by all being ran by JS and is tougher as there is no redo button to redo a step taken.
I made sure that for each level there are many different ways to get to the goal.

By clicking each button to add, subtract, or multiply the goal is to manipulate the starting number to the goal number. 

Because of how YouTube works with embedded videos the final celebration does not play with it being a local host ran website.
